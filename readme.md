# Titanium

Titanium is a Java+JavaFX application that let you administrate your [Squad](http://joinsquad.com/) server using RCON and Steam server queries.

You should also take a look at [Titanium web service](https://github.com/ScreachFr/titanium_webService), a rest API used to send RCON commands.

This software is still under development, stay tuned for future updates!
